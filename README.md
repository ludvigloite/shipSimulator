# shipSimulator

The simulator for marine surface vessels has been developed as part of the Master's thesis 'Simulation-Based, Risk-Influenced Path Planning Framework for Marine Surface Vessels' in 2023 by Ludvig Vik Løite.

If you want to use this framework in further research, I am happy to help with more detailed information and with advice on how to set up the framework. My private e-mail is ([ludvigloite@gmail.com](mailto:ludvigloite@gmail.com))

# Usage

You can reproduce the simulations featured in the case studies from the thesis by executing the 'examples/simulate_different_paths.py' file.

The core ship model can be found in the 'models.py' file.


# Contributing frameworks

The proposed simulator is heavily influenced by the ([ship_in_transit_simulator](https://github.com/BorgeRokseth/ship_in_transit_simulator)), developed by Børge Rokseth.

The simulator has also implemented the ([Seacharts](https://github.com/simbli/seacharts)) framework, developed by Simon Blindheim.
