# shipSimulator

The simulator for marine surface vessels has been developed as part of the 2023 Master's thesis 'Simulation-Based, Risk-Influenced Path Planning Framework for Marine Surface Vessels'.

For researchers interested in leveraging this framework for their own investigations, I am happy to assist - both in the form of in-depth information about the framework, as well as guidance on how to effectively set it up for use. My private e-mail is [ludvigloite@gmail.com](mailto:ludvigloite@gmail.com)

# Usage

You can reproduce the simulations featured in the case studies from the thesis by executing the 'examples/simulate_different_paths.py' file.

The core ship model can be found in the 'models.py' file.


# Contributing frameworks

The proposed simulator is heavily influenced by the [ship_in_transit_simulator](https://github.com/BorgeRokseth/ship_in_transit_simulator), developed by BÃ¸rge Rokseth.

The simulator has also implemented the [Seacharts](https://github.com/simbli/seacharts) framework, developed by Simon Blindheim.
